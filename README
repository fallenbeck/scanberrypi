ScanberryPi
===========

Requirements
------------
You need a RaspberryPi that is set up correctly using Raspbian. You also
need a scanner. In my case, I use an old Canon CanoScan LiDE 200 USB
scanner that is directly attached to my Raspberry Pi.

If you want to upload scanned files to a host, you need some kind of
FTP server. You should configure the FTP settings in etc/scanberrypi.conf.

However, it is always a good example to have a look at this config file
and the code. :)

CAUTION: After a user's remark (thanks Alexander) received in 2021 it seems
         to be impossible to get scanberrypi running on a modern Raspian
         version. Using this scanberrypi version will require the use of an
         old Raspbian version like 2018-04-18-raspbian-stretch-lite.zip:
         http://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/raspberrypi/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2018-04-19/

         However, using an outdated distribution is a *very* suboptimal
         solution for a plenthora of reasons (mainly security reasons).
         Make sure that the Raspberry Pi is not accessible from the outside
         world.

Installation
------------
The scripts are designed for being saved in /opt/scanberrypi. You can
store the scripts in another directory but you then must be sure to
modify the scripts wherever they point to the default installation dir.

The installation is quite simple:
Check out this respository, copy the files to /opt/scanberrypi and run:

	cd /opt/scanberrypi
	cp etc/scanberrypi.conf.sample etc/scanberrypi.conf
	vim etc/scanberrypi.conf
	./bin/setup.sh

During operation, the software logs to the syslog. You can keep track of
its output by calling:
	journalctl -f

Remarks
-------
If you want or need to disconnect and reconnect your scanner while the
Raspberry is running, you might need to restart the scanbd.service to
get the scanner working again:

	sudo systemctl restart scanbd.service
